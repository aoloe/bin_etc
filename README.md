# bin_etc

a collection of scripts and configuration files

the files with the `-encrypt` suffix are encrypted with a weak key (this name), just because i don't want my account to be taken down...  
in vim, start encryptiing a file by typing `:X` and remove the encryption with `set key=`.  
use the scripts by saving a local copy with no encryption (and removing the `-encrypt` suffix).
